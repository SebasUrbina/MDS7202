En t칠rminos del problema, esto ser칤a el porcentaje de futbolistas seleccionados y no seleccionados cuya predicci칩n del modelo coincide con la realidad. Por ejemplo, en el modelo SVM, se tiene que el 94% de los futbolistas fueron correctamente clasificados, considerando ambas clases.\n","\n","Si se considera que la clase positiva es 1, es decir, que el futbolista es seleccionado, la m칠trica Precision cuantifica la proporci칩n de futbolistas clasificados como seleccionados que realmente lo son, dentro de todos los futbolistas que fueron clasificados como seleccionados en el modelo. Por ejempplo, en el modelo KNN, se puede decir que de todos los futbolistas clasificados como seleccionados, solo el 51% result칩 ser efectivamente un futbolista de estas caracter칤sticas.\n","\n","Nuevamente, si se considera que la clase positiva es 1, la m칠trica Recall indica el porcentaje de futbolistas clasificados como seleccionados que realmente lo son dentro de todos los futbolistas que realmente son seleccionados. Por ejemplo, en el modelo ETC, podr칤a decirse que de todos los futbolistas que realmente son seleccionados, el 12% son clasificados como seleccionados por el modelo.\n","\n","Por otro lado, se sabe que el desbalance de los datos podr칤a afectar el desempe침o del modelo. Ya que, en t칠rminos generales, si el algoritmo es entrenado con un set de datos con mucho desbalance en las etiquetas, este podr칤a tener un cierto grado de sesgo para predecir por la clase que tiene una mayor cantidad de datos. Todo esto se menciona porque anteriormente se vi칩 que la cantidad de futbolistas no seleccionados es $16,513$, mientras que la cantidad de seleccionados es $1,075$, por lo tanto, hay un desbalance en las etiquetas. Y en los resultados, esto es apreciable en que la clase 1 tiende a tener peores m칠tricas de desempe침o que la clase 0. De hecho, en el modelo KNN, las m칠tricas de Precision, Recall y F1 para la clase 0 est치n por sobre el 94%, mientras que las mismas m칠tricas para la clase 1 se encuentran bajo el 51%. Resultados similares ocurren para el resto de los modelos SVM y RFC. Sin embargo, la m칠trica de Accuracy para los tres modelos es del 94%, pero esto se debe al propio desbalance, ya que el solo hecho de clasificar gran parte como la clase 0 ayuda a hacer crecer esta medida.\n","\n","Finalmente, se lleg칩 a modelos bastante sesgados en torno a la predicci칩n, ya que tienden a clasificar los registros con la clase de futbolista no seleccionado. Para poder solucionar esto, es decir, reducir el sesgo de los modelos, se podr칤an aplicar t칠cnicas de balance en los datos, como undersampling u oversampling.\n","```"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"5aa0cc14dba04749ad3bc07a92d351d2","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"ix97Ho4uOARH"},"source":["## 1.2 Predicci칩n de posiciones de jugadores [2 puntos]\n","\n","<p align=\"center\">\n","  <img src=\"https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E1rfA1aWEAYU6Ny.jpg\" width=\"500\">\n","</p>"]},{"attachments":{},"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"cell_id":"6cd2eee12b6147bc8eba66af43a1f1f7","deepnote_cell_type":"markdown","id":"oHAwZfV8hMsk"},"source":["En una nueva jornada de desmesuradas transacciones deportivas, Renac칤n escuch칩 a sus colegas discutir acerca de que el precio de cada jugador depende en gran medida de la posici칩n en la cancha en la que juega.
